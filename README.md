TTToe

An alternative Tic Tac Toe game

Since the Boost library is used, you should download it and configure the project's Include Directories.

1) Download and extract the Boost library
2) Add the folder path, where you've extracted the Boost, into Include Directories of the TTToe project (project properties -> Configuration properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories)

That's all.
